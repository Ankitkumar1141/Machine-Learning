# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains the basic implementation of various machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented from scratch using Python, along with explanations and practical examples.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
The repository is organized into different categories of machine learning algorithms:

- **Supervised Learning**
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Naive Bayes
  
- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)


## âš¡ Installation
To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/Ankitkumar1141/Machine-Learning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ml-algorithms
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ðŸš€ Usage
Each algorithm is implemented as a standalone Python script inside its respective folder. Run the scripts as follows:

```bash
python algorithms/supervised/linear_regression.py
```
